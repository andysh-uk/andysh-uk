### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy Heathershaw, a .NET (commercial) and PHP, Go (open-source) developer.

I also enjoy sysadmin responsibility; I'm pretty experienced with Debian and RedHat-based Linux operating systems, as well as Windows Server.

I have over 15 years experience in development behind me, and similar for server (and cloud) management.

You can find me over at [andysh.uk](https://andysh.uk.)
